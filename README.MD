# Decentralized Digital Identity Wallet for Students and Young Professionals

## Project Description
This smart contract enables students and young professionals to register and manage their digital identities on a decentralized blockchain network. Each user has a wallet-linked profile that stores basic identity information securely and transparently.

## Project Vision
To empower early-career individuals with control over their digital identities using blockchain technology â€” making it easier to prove and manage credentials across institutions and employers without relying on centralized authorities.

## Key Features
- *Self-Sovereign Identity*: Users manage their identity directly from their wallets.
- *Decentralized Storage*: No central authority controls or stores identity data.
- *Simple Interface*: Two primary functions: set your identity, and retrieve it.

## Future Scope
- Add verifiable credentials (e.g., university degrees, internships).
- Integration with IPFS for document storage.
- Third-party verification (e.g., employers, institutions).
- Mobile/Web dApp for easy access and UI.
